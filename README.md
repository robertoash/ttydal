## Installation

### For users

```bash
# pipx (recommend)
pipx install sqlit-tui

# uv

   ```

2. Install dependencies using uv:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uv run ttydal
   ```

4. For development with auto-reload (optional):

   Install watchdog for automatic restart on file changes:
   ```bash
   uv add --dev watchdog
   ```

   Run with the development watcher:
   ```bash
   python dev.py
   ```

   This will automatically restart the application whenever you save changes to Python files.

## Configuration

All settings are accessible via the Config page (press `c`).

### Settings

- **Theme**: choose from 12 built-in themes
- **Audio Quality**: select default quality for your playback (max, high, or low)
- **Auto-Play**: enable or disable automatic playback of next track
- **Shuffle**: enable or disable shuffle mode
- **Debug Logging**: enable or disable debug logging to `~/.ttydal/debug.log`
- **API Logging**: *these logs can contains sensitive data* enable or disable API request/response logging to `~/.ttydal/debug-api.log`

All settings are automatically saved when changed.

## Images cache

Loaded images are cached into `~/.cache/ttydal`.

## Tracks cache

ttydal uses a caching system for tracks to improve performance and enable smart search.

### How it works

- In-memory cache: tracks are cached in memory (lost on app restart)
- TTL of 1 hour: each cached album/playlist expires after 1 hour
- Max 50,000 tracks: cache is limited by total track count, not album count.
- LRU eviction: when cache is full, oldest entries are evicted first
- Auto-preload: on startup, all albums are automatically preloaded into cache in the background (mostly for the search feature)

### Cache info modal

Press `i` to open the cache info modal and see current cache statistics.

### Cache invalidation

If you make changes to your playlists/favorites on the Tidal website:

- Press `r` on *Albums* list that clears the entire tracks cache and reloads albums
- Press `r` on *Tracks* list that invalidates only the current album/playlist cache and reloads
